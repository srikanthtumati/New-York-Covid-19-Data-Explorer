A New York Covid-19 Data Explorer I built (heavily WIP) while I was learning Bokeh. View a pregenerated version [here](https://www.srikanthtumati.com/New-York-Covid-19-Data-Explorer/).

The project works by grabbing the latest data from the NY Health Department's website and creating a dashboard that is fully stored in a standalone HTML file. **As the output is simply a standalone HTML file, the script must be rerun to refresh/update the data.**
